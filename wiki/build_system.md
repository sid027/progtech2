## What do we expect from our build tool?

* translates C++ source files to executable binaries
* platform independent
* knows about the hardware it's running on
* automatically finds libraries we tell it to use
* chooses the proper compiler (can be specified)
* enables different release versions
* enables our program to be installed and/or packaged
* automatically resolves dependencies
* facilitates unit testing
* easy to use
* customisable
* fast
