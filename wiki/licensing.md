# Licensing

### Why do we care about licensing?

Software is more often licensed than sold. We want to know about the regulations on:

* ___usage___ barriers: paywall (price tag), permissions (confidential software)
* where and on how many machines we are allowed ___deploy___
* conditions concerning  ___redistribution___
* ___modification rights___ and rules for ___attribution___/___branding___
* ___warranty___ within the current legal framework
* ___source code___ access/visibility

### What do we expect from a license?

* represent our preferences and wishes on the previous points accurately
* ___internationally___ applicable, ___valid___ in ~~all~~ many jurisdictions
* should be well ___understood___ by people in the craft (not obscure)
* handle ___software patents___ (or be conciously silent on them)
* state ___coverage___ on other (non source-code) project parts like documentation, logos, data, ...
* desired level of virality / propagation
