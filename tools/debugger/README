Demonstration files for debugging with gdb and lldb.

Compile the programs with -g -O0 and load them into a debugger (either as a
command line argument or with the 'file' command), then follow the instructions
in the file headers.

An overview of the commands can be found here:
http://lldb.llvm.org/lldb-gdb.html

There are graphical environments to aid debugging (on GNU/Linux):
  ddd, Nemiver
Many editors have built-in or plug-in support for gdb/lldb:
  CodeBlocks, Geany, XCode, KDevelop, NetBeans, Eclipse, ...
